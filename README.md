K-Meleon Extensions are a native type of add-on for K-Meleon, a lightweight and open-source web browser that supports older computers. They are archives that are extracted into K-Meleon's directory. They can be installed with the [K-Meleon Extension Manager](http://kmext.sourceforge.net/kem.htm) or manually extracted. You can extract the exntension using an application like 7zip or Winzip and open its files in any text editor. For more information refer to the [K-Meleon wiki](http://kmeleonbrowser.org/wiki/WriteExtensions).
